Dijkstras-Algorithm:

INTRODUCTION: This project represents a real-time use case of Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently find the shortest path from a given source Node to all other Nodes.  
For real-time applications, we can consider using the HYDERABAD METRO map as a practical example to implement Dijkstra’s algorithm. The Hyderabad Metro network consists of multiple interconnected stations, making it an ideal case for finding the shortest and most efficient routes between locations. By representing the metro stations as nodes and the distances or travel times between them as weighted edges, Dijkstra’s algorithm can help commuters quickly determine the fastest path from one station to another.

Time Complexity: 
The time complexity of this implementation is O(V²) where V is the number of stations. This is because for each station, the algorithm finds the unvisited station with the smallest distance by scanning all stations.
